Egg Timer Written in C#

This is a really basic Egg Timer written in C# after watching a YouTube tutorial.

The Latest Executable can be found over at https://github.com/OliPicard/EggTimer/releases/tag/1.2.1

I have also added some new elements to the mix.

+ Added Buttons over manual input.
+ Added Reset Button.
+ Included correct formatting.
+ Fixed Broken effect if user presses start without entering in a timer number the app will now prompt them to enter in a number. (This fixes the -01 error previously mentioned.)
+ Fixed reset button (which would cause big problems if pressed with the start button.)
