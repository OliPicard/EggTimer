Egg Timer Written in C#

This is a really basic Egg Timer written in C# after watching a YouTube tutorial.

I have also added some new elements to the mix.

+ Added Buttons over manual input.
+ Added Reset Button.
+ Included correct formatting.

**Known bugs**
If you press start at 00:00:00 the timer will display -01. This shouldn't be happening and will be cleared up once i have figured out how to enable/disable bool objects.
